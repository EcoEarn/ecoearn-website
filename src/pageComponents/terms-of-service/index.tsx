          <h2>2. Scope of Service</h2>
          <p>
            EcoEarn provides a decentralized platform facilitating various staking and farming opportunities designed to
            reward users for their participation in supported programs. The services offered by EcoEarn include, but are
            not limited to, the following:
          </p>
          <h3>2.1 Simple Staking</h3>
          <p>
            EcoEarn offers a non-custodial staking service whereby users may stake supported tokens directly through the
            platform. This process allows users to deposit tokens into designated staking contracts, earning rewards in
            accordance with the duration of their stake and the specific terms associated with each staking pool. Users
            retain control of their staked tokens, and all rewards are subject to the terms outlined in the respective
            staking contract.
          </p>
          <h3>2.2 Liquidity Provider (LP) Staking</h3>
          <p>{`EcoEarn supports Liquidity Provider (LP) Staking, allowing users to stake LP tokens that are generated by providing liquidity to supported decentralized exchanges. In return, users may earn additional rewards, which are distributed in accordance with the platform’s predefined reward schedules. LP Staking typically involves staking LP tokens derived from liquidity pools that include assets supported by EcoEarn, contributing to enhanced liquidity within the platform's ecosystem while providing users with staking incentives.`}</p>
          <h3>2.3 Points Staking</h3>
          <p>
            {`EcoEarn's points staking feature allows users to utilize accumulated points to mine additional tokens, fostering long-term engagement and participation with the platform's supported projects. Unlike traditional airdrop mechanisms, Points Staking provides ongoing incentives for active involvement in the ecosystem, encouraging sustained user interaction.`}
          </p>
          <h3>2.4 Rewards Distribution</h3>
          <p>
            EcoEarn calculates and distributes staking and farming rewards to users in accordance with the terms and
            conditions outlined in the respective contracts governing the staking pools or farming programs. Rewards may
            consist of additional tokens, points, or other assets as specified by the platform. EcoEarn ensures
            transparency by providing users with information regarding reward rates, distribution schedules, and any
            relevant updates. Users are encouraged to review such details in order to effectively plan their staking
            strategies.

          <h2>14. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
          <h3>14.1 Agreement to Arbitration</h3>
          <p>
            You and EcoEarn both understand and agree that any claim or dispute arising under these Terms of Service or
            your relationship with EcoEarn (past, present, or future) will be finally settled exclusively by binding
            arbitration in accordance with the United Nation’s UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (at{' '}
            <a
              href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/arbitration/contractualtexts/arbitration"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer"
              className="break-all">

            </a>
            ), which are incorporated into these Terms of Service by reference.
          </p>
          <h3>14.2 Pre-Arbitration Procedures</h3>
          <p>
            You and EcoEarn mutually agree to attempt to resolve all disputes using good-faith and strive for a prompt,
            low-cost, and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first
            send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (a “Dispute Notice”). Any Dispute Notice to EcoEarn must
            be sent{' '}
            <a href="mailto:contact@ecoearn.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              here
            </a>
            , and any Dispute Notice we send to you will be sent to the email address registered with your account or
            otherwise associated with your use of the Site and agreement to these Terms and Conditions. Dispute Notices
            must include each of the following: (a) the contact details of the party providing the Dispute Notice; (b) a
            description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (c) an explanation of the specific relief
            sought, including the total damages sought, if any, and the basis for the damage calculations; (d) a signed
            statement from the party providing the Dispute Notice verifying the accuracy of its contents; and (e) if the
            dispute is from you and you have retained an attorney, then a signed statement from you authorising EcoEarn
            to disclose your account details to your attorney if necessary in resolving your claim or dispute. If an
            agreement is not reached to resolve a claim within 60 days after a notice of demand is received, then either
            party may commence an arbitration proceeding; except that, if either you or EcoEarn send the other an
            incomplete Dispute Notice, the 60-day period begins tolling only after a complete Dispute Notice is
            received. Additionally, if either you or EcoEarn request a telephone discussion, the 60-day period begins
            tolling only after the discussion has occurred. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines will
            be tolled while the parties engage in required informal dispute resolution procedures.
          </p>
          <h3>14.3 Arbitration Procedures</h3>
          <p>
            Should any dispute proceed to arbitration, you and EcoEarn expressly agree that an arbitrator properly
            appointed under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules may issue all appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief
            necessary to ensure the arbitration and final settlement of disputes (but only in favour of the individual
            party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual
            claim). You and EcoEarn agree to keep any arbitration strictly confidential. The properly appointed
            arbitrator will have the authority to order any remedies, legal or equitable, that a party could obtain from
            a court of competent jurisdiction in an individual case based on the claims asserted, and nothing more.
